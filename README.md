DeckBoxJs
=========

A remake of the DeckBox application, this time in Javascript and HTML5 and following much MUCH better coding standards than before

A long time ago (almost 2 years now!) I took up learning Android development in order to make a better Yu-Gi-Oh application for Android, an application that would "rock the ages" or some other term to describe what I wanted out of it. I made significant progress, and learn a good bit about Android development, but I ran into several problems. Firstly, back then I wasn't very good at programming. I was a beginning CS student and I didn't understand how to use all the tools I have. So now, with renewed ambition and a better understanding of how to program, I'm coming back to this project and I'm going to remake it as a HTML5 application. This is going to use responsive design so that people can play from their computer or smartphone and additionally log in to sync it across all the platforms they use. Future features will be added to make it more awesomer but I will take it one step at a time.

This is going to use Dojo since I wanna learn to use it AND it supports object oriented design and mobile development.
